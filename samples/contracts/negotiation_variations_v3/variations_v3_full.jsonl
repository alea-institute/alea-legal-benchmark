Variation B is a realistic compromise likely acceptable to both sides and reduces litigation risk while still giving the employee meaningful protection. Variation C mirrors a strong employer stance; the employee should push to convert it into Variation B or A by negotiating pro rata repayment, carve-outs for employer fault, and limits to recoveries tied only to misconduct."}}, "timestamp": "2025-11-18T13:45:13.017107+00:00"}
